                <h1>Virtual Reminiscence</h1>
                <h3>My inspiration for this Virtual Reminiscence Project came from my own<br>
                    personal experience of growing up in a rural area with my grandparents,<br> 
                    and later moving to the city with my parents. As a child, I was curious about<br>
                    some of the old and worn-out items in our house, such as a box full of<br>
                    fabric scraps. My grandmother told me that they had saved these small <br>
                    pieces of fabric because they were poor and couldn't afford to buy a whole <br>
                    inch of fabric. But now, most people no longer need to save every little piece <br>
                    of fabric. I asked my grandmother why she kept the box full of scraps if they<br>
                    were no longer useful? My grandmother replied by saying that they might<br>
                    come in handy someday. At that point, my mother said that the patches on<br>
                    my socks were made from scraps stored in that box. This childhood memory<br>
                    inspired me to think about why people still hold on to useless items in our<br>
                     modern society, despite the advanced developments we have today. <br>
                    I am interested in the nostalgia that is attached to older objects. With that in<br>
                    mind, I started collecting other peoples' stories that they held onto <br>
                    alongside their personal items that are from the past.</h3>
                    
                <h3>In the city, I found that there are some elderly people who still live their everyday<br>
                    lives as if they are still a part of this  past version of life. They kept  some older <br>
                   habits and lifestyles, such as repairing and continuing to use things even after <br>
                   they had become worn out. For example, when I asked my parents for a new <br>
                   television, after it stopped working, they rejected the suggestion and said that <br>
                   they would try to fix it on their own.  This behavior is not understood by young <br>
                   people and does not align with the modern concept of life. In modern society, it <br>
                   is understood that older things should be thrown away and new ones are <br>
                   bought. For instance,  everyone likes to buy new things, such as  cell phones <br>
                   and computers. This phenomenon can also be partly attributed to the fact that <br>
                   older people are neglected by modern society and are unaware of other  <br>
                   convenient ways of living due to this neglect.</h3>
                   
                <h3>Therefore, I also want to reflect on the conflict between the two ideologies and <br>
                    different lifestyles in my work by bringing awareness to this phenomenon and <br>
                    help the audience understand why t the elderly still choose to live in these old <br>
                    ways while being  in contemporary society. As a young person, I've noticed that <br>
                    our generation also experiences nostalgia.  Rather than keeping old items in our <br>
                    homes the way older people do, we choose to preserve memories in a different <br> 
                    way that is done with our computers and/or cell phones. <br>
                    For example, I kept a picture of a doll on my computer that  was a gift from my <br>
                    grandfather on my 13th birthday. The doll has been discarded, but through this <br>
                    photo, I can still feel the emotional connection to it.<br>
                    During the project, I started to think about how I would reflect all of these ideas <br>
                    at the same time: the creation of nostalgia, the contrast between the past  <br>
                    lifestyle with the present lifestyle,  and the changes that technology has brought <br>
                    to these rural and city based lives. </h3>
                <h3>I tried to use new techniques to deal with old objects.  After a series of trials <br>
                    and investigations, I finally chose a cyberpunk as the project’s  representation.<br>
                     I chose this because cyberpunk was  a good way to showcase the conflict <br>
                    between high-tech and traditional, outdated ways of life that were compelling.<br>
                    
                    I chose to create a webpage in the form of a game that allows viewers to <br>
                    explore the items and their stories on their own, while also allowing the users to <br>
                    experience a sense of virtual reality. The game allows users to search for <br>
                    objects, click on street pictures to enter different rooms, and view collections of <br>
                    objects. Through this interactive experience, I hope to evoke emotions related to <br>
                    nostalgia and our attachment to objects, highlight the differences in our ways of <br>
                    life based on age and location, and how technology has impacted this.</h3>
